key points to remember
1. access modifiers are three : public, private, protected
2. we can inherites either public or protected but not private
3. when we inherit protected, public becomes protected and private remains private
4. when we inherit private, public and protected both becomes private
5. when we inherit public, public becomes public and protected becomes protected
6. we cannot inherit private members
7. we can access public members directly by object.member or pointer->member
8. we can access protected members directly by object.member or pointer->member only inside the class or derived class
9. we cannot access private members directly by object.member or pointer->member
